# rock-paper-scissors
A small project from The Odin project. Rock, paper, scissors written with javascript and played in console. 

This project took me a little longer than I originally planned. 

I learned that I was not breaking the pseudo code down into the smallest problems that I could when I was planning. 
This resulted in me modifying the code more than what I anticipated to get things to work. In the future, I will take 
more time to plan out a solution a bit more. I think this will allow the translation to code a lot easier. 

Anyway, this was a cool project and I am looking forward to what's to come.
